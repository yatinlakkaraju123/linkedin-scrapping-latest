""It is now about life-work integration not about life-work balance""

There is a changed relationship between people and work driven by a) the existential crisis that was Covid which gave  people a new sense of agency over not just their personal lives but work lives  b) the completely different mindset of Gen-Z who will be a third of all employees and have not chosen to sacrifice themselves for their jobs and c) a declining population which is placing more power in the hands of employees and talent.

Heather E. McGowan üè≥Ô∏èüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚ößÔ∏è is the latest guest on What Next? a 30 minute ad free podcast which features guests who deliver actionable insights every minute. Heather who today is an author and speaker has worked in both business and academia and has been called by Tom Friedman an""Oasis of Insights""

She shares amazing ideas and thoughts on how managers cannot lead by using the ways they were lead, how coaching is key vs bossing because the future is about collaboration and not competition and Gen Z will spit your command into your face. 

We speak  how management/bosses make all the difference since 80 percent of people quit bosses not companies,  and your boss determines your mental well being.

And Heather notes Seth Godin's quote that the purpose of the hive is not to make honey but honey is a by-product of a well functioning hive when she speaks about culture.

If you are an employee, employer, teacher or just alive you will find this conversation useful and uplifting.
